# LAB - 2, 3, 4, and 5b

## Project Name: About Me

This project goes over some basic structures of HTML, CSS, and JS. My name asks a few of questions to see how well the user knows about me! In here you can find how some basic functions through JavaScript and all of very lovely CSS and HTML.

You will go over 7 questions: 5 basic yes/no questions, a number guessing game, and a question that has multiple answers.

Becare with multiple attempts of the random number as it generates a new number every time the page is loaded!(There's a secret hint in the console log *wink wink*)

At the end of the game you will find out how many questions you have answered correctly out of 7! But do not worry as you can have fun and play the game over and over again until your hearts desire.

### Reflections and Comments

* Lab 3 was more difficult but not as bad as I had thought using some of the time to work ahead and being able to use some old code and reference for very simular things.
* Learning and how to use Arrays took a little while, but was actaully fun and not as tedius as I once thought.
* The most difficult thing I had come across was not displaying a guess again alert inside of a for-if-else statement. With some help from Norton and past knowledge, finally after a few attempts and help I found my answer with continue statements.
