                    <h2>About me! Charlie!</h2>
                        <p id="underAboutMe">
                            Hello everyone! My name is Charlie Fadness. I am going to tell you a little about myself.
                        </p> 

                    <h3>Cats! Everything Cats! All things Cats!</h3>
                        <p>
                            <img src="/img/Haru and Krissy.jpg" alt="My cats Haru and Krissy"  align="left";> First off, CATS. As you may already know, I love cats, I have two gorgous cats! They try to bother me every time I am in class because they want to play with me. If I could have a chance, one may say that I wouldn't mind having 10 cats. I dont think it would be a bad thing, but at the same. That is a lot maitinence for my cats and cleaning... Oh my... The cleaning, just thinking of it, thats literally like 15 litter boxes, I would be cleaning every hour at that point... Oh man, ok maybe lets hold off on the 10 cats for now. I think thats the best for everyone.

                        </p>

                    <h3>Gaming on the side? Of course!</h3>
                        <p>
                            <img src="/img/gaming-pic.jpg" alt="gamer"  align="left"; width="150px">I mostly play one game right now, I am very addicted to Path of Exile, it is an ARPG, it has a mass amount of customization and does not restrict one class to one certain thing. If you wanna be the tank, but totally go spell caster instead, there is nothing stopping you, and I love it!
                        </p>

                    <h3>Anime!!</h3>
                        <p>
                            I love anime, I not a hardcore anime watcher that has watched everything though, so please don't test me! I am very bad at remembering all the anime and trying to remember all their very long Japanese names haha!
                        </p>

                    <h3>The outside... Oh it's bright...</h3>
                        <p>
                            Although when I do go outside, I love going hiking, going to hike around lakes, mountains, and trails. I sadly have not been to much hiking around, but I do want to hike more and explore everything Washington has to offer! I live in renton, which is great for all the trails near Cougar Mountain! Just a small 20 minute trip and I'm there!
                        </p>

                    <h3>Ohhh.. My sweet tooth is my downfall in Baking</h3>
                        <p>
                            Baking is one thing that I got into in 2019, I have been baking here and there before, but I started to really dive deep and challenge myself to difficult cakes. Some of the most difficult cakes I've done are: Swedish Princess Cake, and my personal creation Ube Cake with Custard Filling, and Italian Meringue Buttercream! I love making either Swiss/Italian Meringue Buttercream, they are not for the average person though! I would definitly rank them for more advanced bakers because you have to be very exact and percise or things wont turn out how you want it to.
